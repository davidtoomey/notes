Notes on Ethereum

Transactions:
  
  nonce: The nonce is how many times the sender has sent a transaction
  
  to: Address of account the money is being sent to (target address)

  value: Amount of ether to send to the target address

  gasPrice: Amount of ether the sender is willing to pay per unit has to get this transaction processed

  startGas/gasLimit: Units of has that this transaction can consume

  v, r, s: Cryptographic pieces of data that can be used to generate the senders account address. Generated from the sender's private key. Used to verify senders private key. So a private key can be used to generate v, r, s, but you cannot get a senders private key from v, r, s. One way action.
